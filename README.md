# Project 0 - Hello
-------------

Deadline: 

Trivial project to exercise version control, turn-in, and other mechanisms.

:warning: Be careful about the changes you make.
I highly recommend waiting until session 2 (04/08/2021).
If you insist on getting started earlier, please let me know
so I can explain everything in advance.
The best way to reach me is through Slack or email.
